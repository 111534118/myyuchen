# Proposal: Add Game Overview Guide

This change will expand the static guide content to include a comprehensive game overview.

## Problem

The current static guide only contains a walkthrough for the very first mission. New players lack a broader understanding of the game's world, characters, and core mechanics.

## Proposed Solution

The content from `doc/misc/PEAK 遊戲概覽與重點資訊.md` will be integrated into the main guide page (`index.html`). This provides players with essential introductory information directly on the main page.

This change will be implemented by modifying the `static-guide` spec.
