# Proposal: Add Search Suggestions Dropdown

This proposal addresses the user's request to enhance the search functionality. Currently, the search bar highlights all matching text on the page and scrolls to the first result. The user desires a more interactive experience where typing into the search box presents a dropdown list of multiple matching page sections, allowing for easier navigation to relevant content.

This change will modify the site's navigation by replacing the highlight-based search with a suggestion-based dropdown. This will involve changes to the HTML structure, CSS styling, and a rewrite of the search JavaScript logic. The `site-navigation` spec will be updated to include requirements for this new behavior.
